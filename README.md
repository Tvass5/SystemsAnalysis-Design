# SystemsAnalysis-Design

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

For the DriverPass Project we are creating a new system for our client and DriverPass owner Liam. In this project we are creating a system that will allow students who are trying to pass their driving tests to be able to take online classes and practice tests in preparation for the actual test. Students will also be able to purchase packages for in person driving lessons, which will give them the hands on training needed to pass the test. By creating this system Liam is hoping to be able to fill a void in the market in regards to training students for their DMV driving test.

# What did you do particularly well?


# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?


# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?


# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
