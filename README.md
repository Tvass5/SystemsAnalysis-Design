# SystemsAnalysis-Design

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

For the DriverPass Project we are creating a new system for our client and DriverPass owner Liam. In this project we are creating a system that will allow students who are trying to pass their driving tests to be able to take online classes and practice tests in preparation for the actual test. Students will also be able to purchase packages for in person driving lessons, which will give them the hands on training needed to pass the test. By creating this system Liam is hoping to be able to fill a void in the market in regards to training students for their DMV driving test.

# What did you do particularly well?

When completing this project I believe that I did a good job creating the system's UML Diagrams. This diagrams will be shared with the project developers in order to create the new DriverPass system.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could choose one part of my work on these documents to revise I would choose the business doucments. Though I did list a few assumptions and limitations, I definitely think that I could have listed more and gone into more detail when it came to these topics. In addition I would also choose to work on my UML Class Diagram I wasn't really clear on how to display the various realtionships bewteen the different objects and would love to be able to go over the diagram and correct some of the relationship that I displayed.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

When designing this system I made sure to pay attention to what the client wanted and also what the students would need in order to utilize the DriverPass system. I then proceeded to document all the systems requirements needed to complete the system. Once I had gathered all the relevant information I began to research the best ways to incorperate all the clients needs. Once I had fully understood the best, most cost effectivie and relevant ways to carryout the client needs, I then started working on the system docucments. These system documents were then given to the developers in order to implement my system design.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

When designig software I begin by documenting all the system requirements and needs, this will give me a clear picture of what the client wants and what tasks the developers would have to complete. I would also utilize the object model and the process model in order to create diagrams to help me to visualize how objects in the system behave and perform real world tasks and to better understand the flow of data within the system. These are some of the strategies that I would use in the future to analyze and design a system.
